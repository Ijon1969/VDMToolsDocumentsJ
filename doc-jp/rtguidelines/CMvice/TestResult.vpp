The class \emph{TestResult} maintains a collection
of references to test cases that have failed. The
exception handler defined in the operation \emph{Run}
of class \emph{TestCase} calls the operation
\emph{AddResult}, which will append the object
reference of the test case to the tail of the sequence
\emph{failures}. The operation \emph{Show} is used
to print a list of test cases that have failed or 
provide a message to indicate that no failures were
found. Note that the standard I/O library, which is
supplied with VDMTools, is used here. \emph{IO.echo}
prints a string on the standard output, just like 
\emph{System.out.println} in Java. The \emph{def
statement} is used to suppress the boolean value 
returned by \emph{IO.echo}:

\begin{vdm_al}
class TestResult

instance variables
  failures : seq of TestCase := []
  
operations
  public AddFailure: TestCase ==> ()
  AddFailure (ptst) == failures := failures ^ [ptst];

  public Print: seq of char ==> ()
  Print (pstr) ==
    def - = new IO().echo(pstr ^ "\n") in skip;
    
  public Show: () ==> ()
  Show () ==
    if failures = [] then
      Print ("No failures detected")
    else
      for failure in failures do
        Print (failure.GetName() ^ " failed")
  
end TestResult
\end{vdm_al}
